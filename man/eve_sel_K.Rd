\title{EVE variance estimator with data-driven K (internal)}
\usage{
eve_sel_K(x, Kmax = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. Input time series.}

\item{Kmax}{Integer. Maximum candidate value of \eqn{K}. Default = 20.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{sigmahat} — Estimated standard deviation by EVE with selected \eqn{K}.
\item \code{K} — The selected value of \eqn{K}.
}
}
\description{
\code{eve_sel_K} computes the EVE variance estimator using a data-driven
truncation parameter \eqn{K}. For each \eqn{k = 1,\dots,K_{\max}}, it constructs
the sequence \eqn{Y_k = T_k/2} from the shifted squared differences of
the input series, and then selects \eqn{K} via \code{selK()}. The variance is
estimated by regressing \eqn{Y_1,\dots,Y_K} on \eqn{1, \dots, K} and taking the
intercept. A warning is issued if the estimated variance becomes negative.
}
\details{
This function serves as the backend for the exported interface \code{EVE()} in the package.
